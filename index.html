    <h1>Understanding Meal Planning</h1>
    <article>
    <p>
        To the uninitiated, meal planning can feel like an elusive practice or an overwhelming task, but that’s usually
        because
        we think about meal planning from the endpoint — when all the recipes have been selected, when all the groceries
        have
        been shopped for, and a week of dinners was successfully made. Put all the information in front of a newbie and
        their
        eyes grow wide with one resounding question: But how do I do it?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What it is: Meal planning is asking the <em><strong>what’s for dinner question</strong></em> once for the whole week, instead of every
            night, and
            then shopping for and prepping the ingredients before cooking. We believe the simplest way to approach meal
            planning is
            with three steps.<br>
        
        
            Select your dinners and their recipes, if needed. <br>
            Shop for ingredients.<br>
            Prepare those ingredients.<br>
        
        </p>

            “Every meal should end with something sweet. Maybe it’s jelly on toast at breakfast or a small piece of
            chocolate at <br>
            dinner – but it always helps my brain bring a close to the meal.”
